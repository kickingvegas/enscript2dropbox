DESCRIPTION
 enscript2dropbox is a utility which generates colorized HTML or pdf output of
 a programming source file and places it into Dropbox for viewing in lieu
 of printing out the source file. By default, output generated will be placed
 in the directory $HOME/Dropbox/Documents/printouts

 Implementation-wise, enscript2dropbox is a Python wrapper around the enscript
 and pstopdf (OS X) or ps2pdf (Linux) utilities. You must also have Dropbox
 installed and configured on your system.

  -h, --help                   print help
  -E[lang], --highlight[=lang] Highlight using enscript --highlight option
  -w[lang], --language[=lang]  Set output file format. Supported formats are html (default) and pdf.
